Before running the deploy,
we need to have VPC endpoint service host to add the terraform deploy IAM user into white list.

After running deploying the endpoint, we need to wait for VPC endpoint service provider to approve the endpoint connection.

example: arn:aws:iam::119217677828:user/TerraformDeploy
